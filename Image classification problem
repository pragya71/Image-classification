IMAGE CLASSIFICATION :
Image Classification is the task of assigning an input image, one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.

Let’s take an example to better understand. When we perform image classification our system will receive an image as input, for example, a Cat. Now the system will be aware of a set of categories and its goal is to assign a category to the image.

This problem might seem simple or easy but it is a very hard problem for the computer to solve. As you might know, the computer sees a grid of numbers and not the image of a cat as how we see it. Images are 3-dimensional arrays of integers from 0 to 255, of size Width x Height x 3. The 3 represents the three color channels Red, Green, Blue.

So how can our system learn to identify this image? By using Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional neural networks or CNN’s are a class of deep learning neural networks that are a  huge breakthrough in image recognition. You might have a basic understanding of CNN’s by now, and we know CNN’s consist of convolutional layers, Relu layers, Pooling layers, and Fully connected dense layers.
SOME EXAMPLE OF IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH PYTHON CODE
# Importing all necessary libraries
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
from keras.layers import Activation, Dropout, Flatten, Dense
from keras import backend as K

img_width, img_height = 224, 224
